## About try_adb_test

The easiest way to retry your Android Instrumented Tests ðŸš€

Under the hood `try_adb_test` uses the stable version of the marvelous [`gojuno composer`](https://github.com/gojuno/composer) and allows you to customize your retry strategy.

| ------- |------------ | ------- |
| apk | Either relative or absolute path to application apk that needs to be tested | |
| test_apk | Either relative or absolute path to apk with tests | |

| try_count | Number of times to try to get your tests green | 1 |
